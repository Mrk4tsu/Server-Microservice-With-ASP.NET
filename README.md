## 📖 Overview  
This project is designed using a **microservices architecture** to provide a scalable and maintainable system. It is developed as part of the **graduation thesis at Nha Trang University**. 

DEMO: [mrkatsu.io.vn](https://mrkatsu.io.vn)
## 🚀 Features 
- **User Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, Firebase Authentication)
- **Service-to-Service Communication** (REST API / gRPC)  
- **Database Management** (MongoDB, SQL Server, Redis) 
- **File Uploads** (MEGA Drive API, Cloudinary) 
- **Logging & Monitoring** (Serilog, ELK Stack) 
- **Caching Mechanism** (Redis)  
## 🏗️ Project Architecture  
The system consists of multiple independent services, including: 
1. **[API Gateway](https://github.com/Mrk4tsu/FinalProject-Microservice-With-NET-and-Angular/tree/main/FN.APIGateway#danh-s%C3%A1ch-x%E1%BB%AD-l%C3%BD-c%C3%A1c-api-gateway)** – Handles request routing, authentication, and rate limiting.  
2. **User Service** – Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles. 
3. **Product Service** – Handles product listings, categories, and inventory. 
4. **Order Service** – Manages orders, transactions, and payments.
5. **Notification Service** – Sends emails, SMS, and in-app notifications.
6. **Logging Service** – Centralized logging and monitoring system. 
7. **Extension** - Other services can be added as needed.
